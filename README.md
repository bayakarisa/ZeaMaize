# The app, called ZeaWatch,
is a Next.js application with a Flask backend that uses AI to detect diseases in maize leaves. The core features include image input (capture or upload), displaying AI predictions (disease, confidence score, description, recommendations, preventive measures), and storing a local scan history. The frontend uses React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI, while the backend uses Flask and Genkit with Google Gemini for AI. Both frontend and backend servers need to be run simultaneously. The README also provides detailed instructions on setting up prerequisites, environment variables (including how to get a Google AI API Key), installing dependencies, running the application, and troubleshooting common issues.
